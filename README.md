So basically we are to simulate how a vacuum cleaner operates in a 10x10 grid environment. The agent's(our vaccuum cleaner) goal is to clean rooms by removing dirt, which randomly accumulates over time, while avoiding walls. The agent can move in four directions, suck dirt when present, or stay idle. Each action costs energy, and the agent is evaluated based on how much dirt it manages to clean while minimizing energy consumption. The environment and agent interact, and after a set number of time steps, the simulation outputs the amount of dirt remaining and the agent's remaining energy, assessing its performance.
